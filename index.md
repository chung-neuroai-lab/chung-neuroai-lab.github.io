        <h2>Our Focus</h2>
        <p>At NeuroAI & Geometric Data Analysis Lab, we are committed to advancing the field of neural science by developing mathematical theories for characterizing the structure of representations in the brain and artificial neural networks. Our research aims to reveal new insights into the brain and to develop new approaches for machine learning. </p>

        <h3>Exploring the Intersection of Brain Science and Deep Learning </h3>
        We are constantly seeking new ways to bridge the gap between brain science and deep learning. A key challenge in understanding how internal representations encode information lies in their high dimensional nature. Our capacity theory formally establishes connections between structure in the high dimensional neural representation and the representation's capacity for categorization. We continue developing the formal theory of efficient neural geometry for tasks beyond categorization, such as shared representations, and continuous or sequential prediction tasks.
