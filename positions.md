<h2> Positions </h2>

<h3> Graduate Student Positions </h3>

[Prospective PhD applicants]
Fall 2026 PhD applicants interested in doing a thesis in our group should apply through Harvard’s Physics, Biophysics, or Neuroscience PhD programs and mention SueYeon Chung in their application materials. Prof. Chung will not be recruiting through SEAS (Applied Math, Applied Physics, or Computer Science) for the Fall 2026 admission cycle.


[Harvard students]
If you are already enrolled at Harvard and are interested in doing a thesis in our group, please contact Prof. Chung by email (with your CV and a brief description of your research interests), regardless of your PhD program.

<h3> Postdoctoral Positions </h3>

Several independent postdoctoral fellowships at Harvard align well with our research, including the Kempner Research Fellowships, Harvard Data Science Postdoctoral Fellowship, CBS-NTT Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Physics of Intelligence, CMSA Postdoctoral Fellowships, and George F. Carrier Postdoctoral Fellowship. Additional collaborative opportunities via the Flatiron Institute are also possible and can be discussed. Direct positions within our group arise regularly; please contact SueYeon for current availability.

<h3> Postbaccalaureate Positions </h3>

The Kempner Institute hosts a postbac program. See <a href="https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/education/post-baccalaureate-program/">here</a> for more details.
