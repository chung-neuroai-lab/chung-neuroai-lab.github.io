<h2> Positions </h2>

<h3> Graduate Student Positions </h3>

<h4> [Prospective PhD applicants] </h4>
If you are interested in pursuing a PhD in our group, consider applying to Harvard programs such as Physics, Biophysics, the Program in Neuroscience, or SEAS programs (including Applied Mathematics, Applied Physics, and Computer Science). If you are deciding between Physics and other programs, Physics is especially recommended since it is Prof. Chung's home department. Please mention SueYeon Chung in your application materials.

<h4> [Harvard students] </h4>
If you are already enrolled at Harvard and are interested in doing a thesis in our group, please contact Prof. Chung by email (with your CV and a brief description of your research interests), regardless of your PhD program.

<h3> Postdoctoral Positions </h3>

Several independent postdoctoral fellowships at Harvard align well with our research, including the Kempner Research Fellowships, Harvard Data Science Postdoctoral Fellowship, CBS-NTT Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Physics of Intelligence, CMSA Postdoctoral Fellowships, and George F. Carrier Postdoctoral Fellowship. Additional collaborative opportunities via the Flatiron Institute are also possible and can be discussed. Direct positions within our group arise regularly; please contact SueYeon for current availability.

<h3> Postbaccalaureate Positions </h3>

The Kempner Institute hosts a postbac program. See <a href="https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/education/post-baccalaureate-program/">here</a> for more details.
